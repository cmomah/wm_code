# WaxMode Code - Quick Notes
- Code is generally well commented, to enable one figure out what's going on
- The locations and uses of files referenced or embeded in the code are described
- The main CSS stylesheet, styles.css is quite bloated. So, for new pages that you develop, it may be easier to create and use a new stylesheet for them. I (Chuka) am familiar with styles.css so I would not have any problems in using it
- Any questions or confusion, please don't hesitate to ask me (Chuka)
